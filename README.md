# Scansector

## A Starsector system visualiser

Scansector loads a given [Starsector] save game and displays a simple grid visualisation
of the objects founds within that system, including stars, planets, moons, and derelicts.

Mission-specific items are indicated by an asterisk.

It's quick-and-dirty and the rendering is a bit naff, but it's good enough to make those
\[redacted\] "in the outer reaches" missions slightly less obnoxious.

Remember star systems are dynamic and things will move over time.  This just tells you
where an object was when you last saved.
